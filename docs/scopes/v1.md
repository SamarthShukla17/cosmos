# Cosmos v1 - Scope Definition

## Purpose
Cosmos v1 is the foundational release of the Cosmos simulation engine. Its purpose is to establish a correct, stable, and extensible core for physics-based simulations, with a primary focus on gravitational N-body systems.

This version prioritizes **engineering quality, correctness, and extensibility** over features and performance optimizations.

## In Scope (v1)

### Physics
- Newtonian gravity
- N-body systems (N >= 2)
- Deterministic force computation
- Softening factor to avoid singularities

### Numerical Methods
- Fixed time-stamp simulation
- Symplectic integrators (e.g., Velocity-Verlet, Leapfrog)
- Energy and momentum conservation validation

### Engine Architecture
- Clear seperation of concerns:
  - World State
  - Physics laws
  - Numerical solver
- Pluggable solver architecture
- Deterministic simulation loop

### Execution
- CPU-based execution only
- Single-process execution
- Reprocible runs with fixed parameters

### Visualization & Debugging
- Basic 2D visualization
- Orbit trajectories for validation
- Logging of key physical quantities

### Tooling & Quality
- Automated tests
- Continuous integration
- Code formatting and linting
- Clear documentation

## Explicitly Out of Scope (v1)

### Physics
- Relativistic gravity
- Electromagnetism
- Fluid dynamics
- Quantum mechanics

### Performance & Hardware
- GPU acceleration
- Distributed simulation
- Multi-threaded optimizations

### Machine Learning
- ML-based solvers
- Surrogate models
- Prediction networks

### Product Features
- GUI applications
- Real-time interactivity
- Game engine integration

## Success Criteria for v1

Cosmos v1 is considered complete when:

- Stable orbits can be simulated over long durations
- Energy drift remains within acceptable bounds
- Architecture allows new solvers to be added without refactoring core logic
- New contributors can understand the system by reading the documentation

---

## Forward Compatibility

Cosmos v1 is intentionally minimal.
Future versions (v2+) may extend the engine with:
- Performance optimizations
- Additional physics modules
- Machine learning integration
- Advanced visualization

These are **explicitly excluded** from v1 to preserve focus and quality.
